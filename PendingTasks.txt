TODO:

1. Show a green marker in front of userid currently in chat
2. show the selected user below, so when he is typing, its more visible

3. optmize ajax calls, use browser cache (chat, friend-list, and other get calls)
4. Use redirect/interceptor to make sure session is not expired

5. Get selected user has issue. There are two places where this info is stored at the moment.
    a. ReceiverInput text field
    b. Message list data prop.
 This needs to solved. Refactor the code and keep the data in one place!!

6. Cache sent messages
7. The message counter badge is not updated properly when the screen is reloaded or user is signed in again.
